Having trying my hands on so many professions, lastly I decided to apply for software development.  I always felt I have special attachments for computers.  The idea to make computer do what you want was always fascinating.  Developing apps, building websites that is useful for many peoples and helping them solve the problem is really rewarding in itself and the pay is decent too.  There are many advantages being a software engineer, you can work remote, go freelancing, work for yourself, grab your laptop, work from McDonalds, starbucks or park while taking out your children.  Well, you can retire and still build what you want to build.  The skill is always there, once you master it.
