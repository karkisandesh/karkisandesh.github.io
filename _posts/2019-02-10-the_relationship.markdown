Finally completed my CLI portfolio project, it was a hard work and took little 
over months, that has more to do with me finding times for the project.  But 
finally completed after almost more than a month.  When I first started, I felt 
like coding was easy, seeing the videos or mentor explaining you, but it was 
not like that.  Seems like coding is more to do with practice, the more you practice
the more you know about it.  Also, using the pry has really helped me to understand
and grasp a deep knowledge what I am really doing with.  

My project was about a scraper app that scrapes a movie website about the 
upcoming movies and the release date.  It will ask the user about the movies, 
to choose an index of the movie which the user wants the details about, and finally
outputs the details.
