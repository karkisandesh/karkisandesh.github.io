So what iS Git and how it got created?  For the past few years, there have been a lot of questions regarding Git and how does it work.   Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, yep the same guy who created Linux kernel, for development of the Linux kernel.  Git is a software configuration management, version control system, which manages changes made to documents,programs, websites, and other collections of information.  It maintains changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among other proglrammers.  It manages the source code history.  They are useful in managing a project, files, as they change over time.  Git stores this set of information in a repository, also known as GitHub.  GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories, much like client-server.  Git is the tool, while GitHub is for Git.

In today's programming world, one of the biggest advantages of Git has over its competitors is its branching capabilities.  Git branches are easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular with many Git users. Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase.  So, basicallty, Git is distributed version control system, where all users have a complete copy of the entire repository, which helps different individual to  work on the project independent of any network connection and when connected, you can push your changes to GitHub and merge with GitHub.
